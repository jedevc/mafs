# QuickFS (qufs)

QuickFS is a simple to use tool that allows you to easily create virtual
filesystems using FUSE.

If you've ever wanted to play around with filesystems, but have been put off by
the complexity of libfuse, this library could be for you. You can easily create
whole, feature-complete filesystems in just a few lines of code. No need for
painstakingly dealing with folder structures and buffers, qufs manages all the
low-level details, provides sane defaults, and lets you focus on functionality.
